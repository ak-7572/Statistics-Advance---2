        "\n",
        "#### **Key Concepts in the CLT:**\n",
        "\n",
        "# 1. **Sample Mean Distribution**:\n",
        "#   - As \\( n \\) increases, the **distribution of the sample mean** becomes more and more like a normal distribution, even if the original population distribution is not normal.\n",

Typically, a sample size of \\( n \\geq 30 \\) is considered large enough for the CLT to apply, but in some cases, smaller sample sizes might suffice, depending on the shape of the original distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. **Independence**:\n",
        "#   - The random variables (samples) must be independent of each other. This means that the outcome of one trial should not affect the outcome of another.\n",

        "# - **Step 1**: We randomly select a sample of **30 women** (which is typically considered large enough for the CLT to apply).\n",
        "# - **Step 2**: We calculate the **sample mean height** and the **sample standard deviation** for that sample.\n",
        "# - **Step 3**: Now, imagine we repeat this process — selecting a random sample of 30 women, calculating the mean height, and repeating this process many times (say, 10,000 times).\n",
        "# - **Step 4**: According to the Central Limit Theorem, if we plot all these sample means (i.e., the distribution of sample means), it will **approach a normal distribution**. This happens even if the original distribution of heights is not normal (e.g., if the original distribution is skewed).\n",
        "\n",
        "# **Why this is useful**: The CLT allows us to make inferences about the population mean (in this case, the average height of all adult women in the country) based on the sample mean, even when the original data is not normally distributed. Since the distribution of sample means will be approximately normal, we can use standard techniques from normal distribution (like confidence intervals or hypothesis tests) to estimate population parameters.\n",

        "#### **Illustration**:\n",
        "# - Suppose the original distribution of heights has a **mean** of 160 cm and a **standard deviation** of 10 cm.\n",
